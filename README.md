This React web application has been developed as part of a project involving a list of Star Wars spacecraft. However, due to technical issues with the login integration using json-server-auth, the login functionality is not fully implemented.

**Access to the Starships List**
To facilitate reviewing and using the application, the protection of the route leading to the Starships list in the App component has been commented out. This means that users can now directly access the Starships list without the need to log in.

It is understood that this is not the ideal implementation, and efforts are underway to address the technical issues related to json-server-auth in future updates.
